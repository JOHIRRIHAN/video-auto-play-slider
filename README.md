# Continuous Looping Video Slider with Active Middle Card

This project implements a **continuous looping video slider** where the **middle card** is always active and takes up **70% width** while the left and right cards take **15% width** on small devices. The slider loops automatically, creating a seamless transition of slides from the last to the first one.

## Features

- **Continuous Looping**: The slider loops seamlessly from the last slide back to the first one and vice versa.
- **Middle Active Card**: The active card always takes the center position and is highlighted (taking up 70% width on small devices).
- **Automatic Sliding**: The slides automatically move every 20 seconds.
- **Responsive Design**: On small devices, the active card takes 70% of the width, and the left and right cards take 15% each.
- **Video Playback**: Clicking the play button or the video thumbnail will play the video.
